# chat

-   The project is actually just: write a neat little chat app with a server and a client

Since the first idea the project has kinda mutated.
You can have a look at a more recent requirement list [here](https://github.com/stho32/LocalNetAppChat/blob/main/Documentation/Index.md).
(It can be browsed using https://obsidian.md/ )
