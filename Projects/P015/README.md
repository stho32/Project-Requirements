# OrgView

You are part of an organisational structure. Your task is to make this structure visible.

There are the following elements in the structure you want to display: 

- [ ] There is a root node "The Company"
- [ ] Below that root node every node represents a person with attributes.
- [ ] Every parent-node can have an unlimited list of sub-nodes.
- [ ] Since every node represents a person and companies are a mess, people can pop up multiple times in the hierarchy.


- [ ] Find a way to create random structures and display them.
- [ ] Enable the following functions:
    - [ ] When you hover above a person, all other places the person pops up should be highlighted as well.
    - [ ] You can search the tree to find a person quickly.
