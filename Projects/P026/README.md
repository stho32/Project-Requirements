# cld cloud meta tool

## Level 1

-   You can start with your preferred local provider e.g. hyper-v.
-   Write a script that creates you a virtual machine with a basic linux or windows installation.
-   The script should create a "fresh install" or copy from a base image that you provide.
-   The script should start the newly created vm after finishing and display the relevant data for accessing in the terminal.

## Level 2

-   Find a way to extend the functionality of your script so that it works with 2 local providers or one of the major or minor clouds out there, too.
