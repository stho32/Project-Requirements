# "split", Splitting costs in a group of people

Imagine you go on holidays in a group. 

- There are always expenses, and there is always someone that pays.
- Some expenses are for more than one person. (E.g. Bob buys food for everyone).
- The costs need to be splitted.

Write an application that can return the amount of money each person ows any other person in the group.

It should return a list of payments and who has to pay whom to equally distribute all expenses throughout the group.
