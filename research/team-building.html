          <li>Good software developers are not rockstars.</li>
          <li>Seeing software developers as individual heros is counter-productive, while playing nicely with egos, those kinds
            of heroism often leave a big mess in the code.</li>
          <li>If you have a team member that you cannot trust with your code, do not try to solve the problem by becoming more burocratic.
            Fix the problem by making the people you do not trust more trustworthy.

          <li>The unit of delivery in software delivery is the team! We want good people, but even more than that, we want good teams.</li>
          <li>Refers to research by Raymond Meredith Belbin</li>
          <li>Its about recognizing your strengths and maximizing them, and working with other people that cover your weeknesses while you cover theirs.</li>
          <li>A great team has a good mix of strengths.</li>
          <li>Google Project Aristotle findings:
            <ul>
              <li><mark>Dependability</mark><br>
                Work is done in time and in a high standard</li>
              <li><mark>Structure and clarity</mark><br>
                the team and each member of it understands his role and how it fits into the bigger picture. People understand what they do and why they are doing it.

              <li><mark>Meaning</mark><br>
                The work is important to the team members. Gallup found that people that use their strengths at work are 
                6 times more likely to be engaged in their work. Playing to their strengths allows them to take 
                ownership of the work.
              </li>
              <li><mark>Impact</mark><br>
                Team members believe that what they are working on matters.

              <li><mark>Psychological safety</mark><br>
                The degree in which people on the team trust each other and are willing to take risks.
