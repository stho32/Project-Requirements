    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>This book helps you in case you have delegation related problems.</p>
    <p>The author describes the life of a manager that has not enough time for his family while.
      He is working a lot while his employees have a lot of time and a good life and seem to give all 
      the work to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the book explains us how managers become this way. At the start, they are normal employees but then
      they get promoted and a journey begins where the young managers have to learn a different set of abilities
      which often goes wrong. What are those pitfalls? How can they be explained?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the book describes methods to keep the employees at bay. For this you need to know
      the exact way in which employees try to give you back the tasks that you gave to them and 
      how to counter so that you help them but still make sure that the "monkey" (the task) stays with 
      them.
