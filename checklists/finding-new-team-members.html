    <h1>Finding new team members</h1>

    <p>
      You will have to test two different parts of you potential new employee:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Character/Personality</li>
        <li>Competency</li>
      </ol>

      Now the second one is relativly easy. Give them some little work to do. You know how your team works, 
      so in a team that works only remotly and never sees each other a github repository might be enough.
      If your team works in pairs with lots of communication, well, you should set up your testing scenario in 
      a way that matches your every day work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The first one, character/personality, is much harder. The way it is normally applied is by "just asking"
      some questions and then deciding if the person is "nice".
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the usual and often failing way you can use these different models:
      <ul>
        <li>"The ideal team player" is a book that describes hungry, smart and humble as the best team player traits.
          You can find a summary in the resources section of this website.
        </li>
        <li>
          The "cliftonStrengths"-Assessment is a professional assessment of 34 different traits with practical help on 
          how you can best integrate that person. What are the things he/she is good or bad at? It only takes half an hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find and use a Big-Five-Personality Test. This test is not scientific, but known to deliver good results. 
          From all character traits a person can have the creators of the test have taken the 5 ones, that are not 
          likely to change over a persons lifetime. (Although it is known that the neuroticism result can be changed
          by applying psychological therapy). So these tests give you a good hint. There are not a psychological assesment.
          They reduce the number of different people types to 16, which is still easy to grasp.
        </li>
      </ul>
